# GitHub Hide Annotations

> ⚠️ This is now built-in to GitHub

Currently GitHub doesn't give you a way to toggle [Check Run Annotations](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-07-new-checks-api-public-beta/) like they do inline comments.
This UserCSS style can be toggled on and off to hide the annotations as needed.

## Installation

1. You will need a userstyle extension that supports UserCSS such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app/).
2. [Install the UserCSS](github-hide-annotations.user.css).
